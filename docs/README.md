## Introduction

    While I was still in high school I really enjoyed computer games. I enjoyed them so much I ended up scouring Youtube for ways I could modify and edit the content of my games. When I wasn't in front of a computer, I was on the wrestling mat. After ten years of that, I needed a change of pace, so I joined the ROTC program at my high school. From there I joined the traveling shooting team, and the following year, was promoted to Air Rifle Captain.

    Now, I am a student at Deep Dive Coding and I am studying software development in java and android. My goal for after this boot camp is to become a certified java developer, and be on a team that develops new software for smart devices like cell phones, smart watches, vehicle displays, and anything else I'll be able to get my hands on.

    As a long term goal, I am interested in marketing a few of my own app ideas that I would like to develop on my own time.
